Knowing now how we use our db, where our AI features go and so forth the next step in our creator layer is a book publishing system. We will be able to create any type of book from stories with pictures to puzzle books etc. We need also be able to bundle books and more. Our book editor is more or less already complete. You will see the first page is a double page with a little space in the middle because that will be our cover (back and front), we can also set the sizes and more. Please look at our pages in layers/creator/pages/publishing our composable #file:usePublishing.ts and our components in layers/creator/components/publishing. this will also be linked to our book research that we did which is in layers/research #file:README.md please ask me any clarifying questions before we start. #file:user-details.md #file:user-details2.md #file:user-details3.md #file:user-details4.md after your questions we will start with documentation

Looking at the files you've provided, I can see you're developing a sophisticated book publishing system in the creator layer. Before we start with documentation, I'd like to clarify several key aspects to ensure we're aligned on the implementation:

1. Integration Architecture:

How closely should the publishing system integrate with the video creation features already in the creator layer?
What specific data should flow between the research layer and the publishing system?


2. Book Types & Templates:

Beyond stories and puzzle books, what other specific book types should be supported?
Do you envision preset templates for different book genres/types?


3. Production Workflow:

What is the envisioned end-to-end workflow from research to published book?
Will there be any automated publishing to platforms like Amazon KDP, IngramSpark?


4. AI Feature Integration:

Looking at user-details files, I see references to AI writing features like Squibler and Sudowrite - which specific AI features should we prioritize for the publishing system?
Should we implement different AI models for different types of books?


5. Collaborative Aspects:

Will there be multi-user collaboration features similar to what you've implemented for video projects?
How should version control work for books with multiple contributors?


6. Current Implementation Status:

What components/pages already exist in the publishing section?
Are there any existing database schemas for books I should be aware of?

7. Monetization:

Will there be specific monetization features like the ones mentioned in user-details4.md?
How should bundling books work from both a technical and business perspective?
These clarifications will help me develop more targeted and useful documentation for the publishing system.


1. It doesnt have to be closely integrated, but would be nice to use some of the functionlaity for instance if we want to create an image for the book we can use the same ai endpoints. The data is so that we can use the example books and our resaerch findings to the LLM so that they know what we want to build and help it with enough context.

2. All book types you can think off, colouring books, mazes, word search, kids storie (so lots of images), please look in the editor composable at all the different things. Yes I do envision preset templates.

3. I will first do research in the already completed book research module. Then I create a book and link it to the search. Then in the book editor I will start te create the book with drag and drop editor and more. There will be automated publishing yes.

4. I will use my chat module and give functions that the LLM can use to create the book get info in #file:publishing.ts

5. Yes there will be collaboration. you can decide on the version control.

6. There is a lot already implemented. Can you see the folders I have attached or should I tag each file individually?

7. No monetization for now, its more on how we are going to charge for the books on for instance amazon kdp. We will just like to sell bundles of a series on KDP.

please let me know if you can go through the exiting files as mentioned or if I have to tag the individual files. If there is any other questions please ask otherwise start the documentation in the order you see fit #file:brd.md #file:drd.md #file:frd.md #file:prd.md #file:uxdmd.md #file:uxsmd.md and last do the #file:todo.md
