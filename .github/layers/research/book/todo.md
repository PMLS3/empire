## Implementation Details

### Vector Embedding Strategy

1. **Text Preprocessing**
   - Normalize and clean text before generating embeddings
   - Split long content into chunks of appropriate size
   - Extract key sections for more targeted embeddings

2. **Embedding Generation Workflow**
   - Generate embeddings for book descriptions immediately upon creation
   - Queue content embeddings for background processing
   - Update embeddings when source content changes
   - Store embedding provider and model information with vectors

3. **Provider Selection Logic**
   - Use VertexAI as default provider when available
   - Fall back to OpenAI if VertexAI is unavailable
   - Allow user overrides for specific use cases
   - Support for switching providers without regenerating all embeddings

4. **Vector Search Optimization**
   - Pre-compute common similarity metrics
   - Use approximate nearest neighbor for large collections
   - Implement hybrid search (keyword + vector) for better results
   - Cache frequent similarity queries

### Integration Points

1. **FireCrawl Integration**
   - Connect through server-side API for security
   - Implement rate limiting and retry logic
   - Cache responses to minimize repeated calls
   - Transform scraped data to match internal models

2. **Perplexity AI Integration**
   - Use server-side proxy for API access
   - Implement streaming responses where appropriate
   - Cache common research queries
   - Combine with vector search for enhanced results

3. **Embeddings Utility Integration**
   - Seamless connection with embeddings.ts
   - Error handling for provider failures
   - Fallback chains for reliability
   - Performance monitoring and logging

4. **LLM Agent Integration**
   - Update function declarations for research capabilities
   - Implement vector context retrieval
   - Create specialized prompts for book research
   - Build evaluation metrics for answer quality

### Technical Dependencies

1. **Backend Dependencies**
   - Node.js with Express/Fastify
   - Vector database (e.g., Pinecone, Qdrant, or PostgreSQL with pgvector)
   - Firebase/Firestore for document storage
   - Redis for caching and job queues
   - LangChain for embeddings and LLM interactions

2. **Frontend Dependencies**
   - Vue.js with Nuxt.js
   - Pinia for state management
   - TailwindCSS for styling
   - D3.js for data visualization
   - Three.js for 3D vector space visualization (optional)

### Migration Strategy

1. Implement basic functionality without vectors first
2. Add vector capabilities as an enhancement
3. Gradually migrate existing data to include embeddings
4. Provide feature flags for enabling/disabling vector features
5. Create fallback to traditional search when vectors unavailable
