Below is a detailed specification document for implementing a system similar to Faceless.so within a Nuxt3 environment. This system will allow users to generate AI-powered videos by selecting their preferred audio and video services from the frontend, automating content creation, scheduling, posting to platforms like YouTube and TikTok, and tracking performance. The document outlines the architecture, components, workflows, and considerations necessary to achieve this.

---

## **1. Project Overview**

The objective is to create a full-stack application using Nuxt3 that enables users to:
- Choose a niche, voice style, caption style, and content source (e.g., custom prompts, Reddit posts, or blog URLs).
- Select audio (text-to-speech) and video generation services from the frontend.
- Generate videos using AI based on their inputs.
- Schedule and automatically post videos to YouTube and TikTok.
- Monitor video performance and receive optimization suggestions.

The system will be modular, integrating with multiple third-party services for audio and video generation, ensuring flexibility and user control.

---

## **2. Architecture**

The system comprises the following components:
- **Frontend**: Built with Nuxt3 (a Vue.js framework) for user interactions, service selection, and content management.
- **Backend**: A Node.js server (using Express or Nuxt3’s Nitro) to handle API requests, integrate with third-party services, and manage data.
- **Database**: Stores user data, service preferences, generated content, and performance metrics (e.g., MongoDB or PostgreSQL).
- **Third-Party Services**: For AI content generation (e.g., OpenAI for text, Stable Diffusion for images, Google Text-to-Speech for audio).
- **Task Scheduler**: Automates video generation and posting (e.g., Node-Cron).
- **Queue System**: Manages concurrent video generation tasks (e.g., Bull or AWS SQS).

---

## **3. Frontend (Nuxt3)**

The frontend provides an intuitive interface for users to configure settings, select services, and manage content.

### **3.1 Key Pages and Components**
- **Dashboard**: Displays current settings, past videos, and performance metrics.
- **Settings Page**: Allows users to select niche, voice style, caption style, and input content sources.
- **Service Selection**: A dedicated section for choosing audio (TTS) and video generation services from available options.
- **Scheduling Interface**: Enables users to define posting schedules for YouTube and TikTok.
- **Performance Dashboard**: Shows analytics (e.g., views, engagement) and optimization suggestions.

### **3.2 Service Selection**
- The frontend dynamically fetches available audio and video services from the backend via an API call (e.g., `/api/services`).
- Users select their preferred services (e.g., Google TTS for audio, Stable Diffusion for images) using dropdowns or cards.
- Each service option includes a name, description, and possibly usage cost for transparency.

### **3.3 Implementation Notes**
- Use Nuxt3’s component system to modularize the UI (e.g., `<ServiceSelector>`, `<ContentInput>`).
- Leverage Nuxt3’s built-in server routes (Nitro) for API communication.
- Ensure responsiveness and accessibility for a seamless user experience.

## **4. Backend (Node.js)**

The backend processes API requests, integrates with third-party services, and manages the content generation pipeline.

### **4.1 API Endpoints**
- **User Management**: `/api/users` (register, login, update profile).
- **Service Configuration**: `/api/services` (list available audio and video services).
- **Content Generation**: `/api/generate` (initiate text, image, and audio generation).
- **Video Production**: `/api/produce-video` (assemble content into a video).
- **Scheduling**: `/api/schedule` (manage posting schedules).
- **Posting**: `/api/post` (upload videos to social platforms).
- **Analytics**: `/api/analytics` (retrieve performance data).

### **4.2 Service Integration**
To support user-selected services from the frontend:
- **Audio (TTS) Services**:
  - Define an abstract `TTSService` interface with a method: `generateAudio(text: string, voice: string): Promise<AudioFile>`.
  - Implement concrete classes (e.g., `GoogleTTSService`, `AmazonPollyService`) for each provider.
- **Video (Image Generation) Services**:
  - Define an abstract `ImageService` interface with a method: `generateImage(prompt: string): Promise<ImageFile>`.
  - Implement concrete classes (e.g., `StableDiffusionService`, `DALLEService`).
- The backend uses the user’s selected service dynamically for each task.

### **4.3 Content Generation Pipeline**
- **Text Generation**:
  - Custom prompts: Use a language model (e.g., OpenAI GPT) to generate text.
  - Reddit posts: Fetch via Reddit API and summarize or reformat.
  - Blogs: Extract content from URLs and process accordingly.
- **Image Generation**:
  - Generate or fetch images based on text using the selected service.
- **Audio Generation**:
  - Convert text to speech using the chosen TTS service and voice style.

### **4.4 Video Production**
- Assemble images, audio, and captions into a video using FFmpeg.
- Use predefined templates per niche (e.g., chat-style videos for text messages, documentary-style for historical content).
- Store videos in cloud storage (e.g., AWS S3) and return a URL to the frontend.

### **4.5 Scheduling and Auto-Posting**
- Use Node-Cron to schedule video generation and posting based on user preferences.
- Implement OAuth flows for YouTube and TikTok to post on behalf of users.
- Handle API-specific requirements (e.g., video format, metadata).

### **4.6 Performance Tracking**
- Fetch analytics from YouTube and TikTok APIs periodically.
- Store data in the database and expose it via the `/api/analytics` endpoint.
- Optionally, analyze trends and suggest optimizations (e.g., adjust niche or style).

## **5. Database Schema**

The database stores essential data for users, services, content, schedules, and analytics. Below is an example schema for MongoDB:

```json
{
  "users": [
    {
      "id": "string",
      "email": "string",
      "preferences": {
        "niche": "string",
        "voiceStyle": "string",
        "captionStyle": "string",
        "audioService": "string",
        "videoService": "string"
      },
      "credits": "number",
      "socialAccounts": {
        "youtube": "string",
        "tiktok": "string"
      }
    }
  ],
  "services": [
    {
      "id": "string",
      "type": "audio|video",
      "name": "string",
      "description": "string",
      "apiKey": "string"
    }
  ],
  "content": [
    {
      "id": "string",
      "userId": "string",
      "text": "string",
      "images": ["string"],
      "audio": "string",
      "video": "string",
      "status": "generated|posted"
    }
  ],
  "schedules": [
    {
      "userId": "string",
      "platform": "youtube|tiktok",
      "frequency": "daily|weekly",
      "time": "string"
    }
  ],
  "analytics": [
    {
      "videoId": "string",
      "platform": "youtube|tiktok",
      "views": "number",
      "engagement": "number",
      "date": "date"
    }
  ]
}
```

## **6. Third-Party Services**

The system integrates with multiple services for flexibility:
- **Text Generation**: OpenAI GPT, Anthropic Claude.
- **Image Generation**: Stable Diffusion, DALL-E, Unsplash (stock images).
- **Text-to-Speech**: Google Text-to-Speech, Amazon Polly, Microsoft Azure TTS.
- **Video Posting**: YouTube API, TikTok API.

Each service requires API keys, and usage must be monitored to manage costs and limits.

---

## **7. Credit and Subscription System**

- **Credit Mechanism**: Video generation costs credits (e.g., 10 credits per video).
- **Subscription Plans**: Monthly credit allotments (e.g., Starter: 500 credits, Pro: 1000 credits).
- **Management**: Track credits, deduct on video generation, and restrict usage if credits are depleted.
- **Payment**: Integrate Stripe or a similar gateway for subscriptions.

---

## **8. Security and Compliance**

- **Authentication**: Use JWT or OAuth for secure user access.
- **Encryption**: Encrypt API keys and social media tokens.
- **Compliance**: Adhere to YouTube and TikTok policies for automated posting.
- **Privacy**: Implement GDPR-compliant data handling.

---

## **9. Development and Deployment**

### **9.1 Development Steps**
1. **Setup**: Initialize a Nuxt3 project with Nitro for server-side routes.
2. **Authentication**: Implement user registration and login.
