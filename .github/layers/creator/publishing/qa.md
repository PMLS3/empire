Knowing now how we use our db, where our AI features go and so forth the next step in our creator layer is a book publishing system. We will be able to create any type of book from stories with pictures to puzzle books etc. We need also be able to bundle books and more. Our book editor is more or less already complete. You will see the first page is a double page with a little space in the middle because that will be our cover (back and front), we can also set the sizes and more. Please look at our pages in layers/creator/pages/publishing our composable #file:usePublishing.ts and our components in layers/creator/components/publishing. this will also be linked to our book research that we did which is in layers/research #file:README.md please ask me any clarifying questions before we start. #file:user-details.md #file:user-details2.md #file:user-details3.md #file:user-details4.md after your questions we will start with documentation
