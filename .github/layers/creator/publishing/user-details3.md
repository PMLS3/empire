It seems likely that Novelcrafter and Sudowrite are strong alternatives, especially for organizing and fiction writing, respectively, but Squibler stands out for versatility.
The evidence leans toward Squibler due to its broad features and positive user feedback, though preferences may vary based on specific needs like genre or technical expertise.
Overview
Squibler appears to be the top choice for creating books using AI, particularly for users seeking a versatile, all-in-one tool. It excels in generating full-length books, offering AI-assisted writing, and providing additional features like visuals and printing services. However, the choice can depend on whether you're focusing on fiction, nonfiction, or need advanced customization, where alternatives like Novelcrafter or Sudowrite might also fit well.
Features and Suitability
Squibler is designed for both novice and experienced writers, with features like story outline generation, AI Smart Writer for editing, and project management tools. It's particularly noted for its ability to generate entire books from a basic draft, making it ideal for users wanting a quick start. Novelcrafter, on the other hand, is praised for its organizational tools like The Codex and AI assistance with custom models, which might appeal to those who prefer more control over the AI process. Sudowrite is highly regarded for fiction, offering features like Brainstorm Mode and Story Engine, but it's less versatile for nonfiction.
User Experience and Cost
Squibler offers a free plan with 6,000 AI-generated words monthly and a Pro plan at $240/year, providing unlimited features including book cover design and printing. Novelcrafter starts at $4/month, with a top tier at $20/month for collaborative writing, making it more affordable for some.

Background and Methodology
The inquiry into the best AI book writing software began with a broad search for tools specifically designed to create books using AI, covering both fiction and nonfiction. Sources included expert reviews from platforms like Kindlepreneur, user testimonials on Trustpilot, and detailed feature lists from official websites. The analysis prioritized tools with robust AI integration for writing, generation capabilities, and user-friendly interfaces, ensuring relevance for layman users. Comparisons were made based on pricing, feature sets, and community feedback, with a focus on tools mentioned in recent 2025 reviews.
Key Findings: Top Contenders
Three tools emerged as primary contenders: Squibler, Novelcrafter, and Sudowrite. Each offers unique strengths, but their suitability varies based on user needs.
Squibler: Positioned as a comprehensive AI writing platform, Squibler is noted for its ability to generate full-length books from initial concepts, with features like AI Smart Writer, elements creation (characters, settings), and done-for-you printing. Its website claims support from 20,000 writers globally, and it offers a free plan with 6,000 AI-generated words monthly, escalating to a Pro plan at $240/year for unlimited features, including book cover design and weekly live sessions (Squibler Website). Reviews on Trustpilot and Product Hunt highlight its ease of use and motivational features like the "Dangerous Writing Prompt," though some users note limitations in flexibility (Trustpilot Reviews).
Novelcrafter: Recommended by Kindlepreneur as one of the best AI writing tools for both fiction and nonfiction, Novelcrafter focuses on organization with The Codex, a personal wiki for story elements, and AI assistance via custom models (users bring their own AI key). Pricing starts at $4/month for basic features, with the Artisan plan at $20/month offering collaborative writing. Its strengths lie in planning and reviewing, with a 21-day free trial, but it lacks explicit full-book generation, focusing more on enhancing existing drafts (Novelcrafter Pricing). User feedback on platforms like DreamGen suggests it's a go-to for structured writing, though visibility in reviews is lower compared to Squibler (DreamGen Review).
Sudowrite: Tailored for fiction writers, Sudowrite is praised for features like Brainstorm Mode, Story Engine, and Rewrite functionality, helping users overcome writer's block and generate detailed narratives. Reviews, such as those on Tom's Guide, report users completing novels in weekends, with pricing starting at $29/month for mid-level tiers (Sudowrite Review). However, it's less versatile for nonfiction, making it a niche choice compared to the others.

User Experience and Community Insights
User experiences vary, with Squibler benefiting from a larger community presence, as seen in its 20,000 writer claim and active discussions on Reddit and Product Hunt. Novelcrafter, while less visible, is backed by Kindlepreneur's 2025 list, suggesting strong professional approval (Kindlepreneur AI Tools). Sudowrite's niche focus on fiction is evident in user stories of rapid novel completion, but its lack of versatility for nonfiction limits its appeal for general book creation.

Squibler's Pro plan at $240/year is competitive for unlimited features, while Sudowrite's $29/month mid-tier is higher, reflecting its specialized fiction focus. The free tier of Squibler and Novelcrafter's trial period provide low-risk entry points for users to test AI capabilities.
Conclusion and Recommendation
Based on the analysis, Squibler emerges as the best software for creating books with AI due to its comprehensive features, including full book generation and user-friendly AI integration, supported by a large user base and positive reviews. It suits writers seeking versatility across genres, with additional benefits like printing services and weekly live sessions. However, for users prioritizing organization and planning, especially with custom AI models, Novelcrafter is a strong alternative, and for fiction-focused writers, Sudowrite is highly effective. The choice depends on specific needs, but Squibler's broad applicability and feature set make it the top pick for general book creation with AI as of March 2025.
